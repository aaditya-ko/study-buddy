# StudyBuddy Live — Demo Walkthrough (2–3 minutes)

1) Landing
   - Open `/` and pick “Standard” intensity.
   - Click the plus and upload the prepared PDF (e.g., Problem Set 4 – Recursion).

2) Session greet
   - Grant camera permission.
   - Say nothing for ~30–40s. The proactive voice should ask, “What are you thinking right now?”

3) Focus the problem
   - Click Highlight, drag a rectangle around “Problem 3”, then click “Set current problem”.

4) Show Work
   - Click “Show Work” and hold your paper to the camera. The AI should give 1–2 targeted nudges.

5) Breakthrough
   - If the ambient classifier returns a “breakthrough” state, confetti fires.

6) Wrap
   - Optional: visit `/sessions` to show persisted sessions when Supabase is configured.

Notes
- Without API keys, routes return friendly stubs (works offline).
- For the real demo, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and Supabase env vars and redeploy.
